# vx

All you need to know is [Getting started with GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/getting-started-with-github-page).

Fortunately your can use this project directly, for example: https://xx.github.io/xx/?src=http://baidu.com

Also you can custom domain this project for account/organization/project by yourself.

If you want to host it with https enabled by caddy, copy Caddyfile.example to Caddyfile and update it first line. Then run `nohup sudo ../go/bin/caddy &`
